November 7, 2023:
- Added bar chart that displays number of times an image was seen and number of times an images was clicked
- Could not figure out the algorithm to ensure the same image is not displayed on two subsequent iterations. I tried putting used pictures into a used pictures array, then after 2 clicks, restore those images back into the pictures array for future iterations
